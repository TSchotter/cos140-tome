# Chapter 1 - Boolean Algebra

[&laquo; Return to the Table of Contents](../index.md)

Boolean algebra is the foundation of digital logic and computer science. It deals with binary variables and logical operations that form the basis of all digital circuits and computer operations. Understanding Boolean algebra is essential for anyone working with computers, from software development to hardware design.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll master the fundamental concepts of Boolean algebra, including:

- **Binary Logic**: Understanding the two-state system (0 and 1, True and False)
- **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, NOT, and their combinations
- **Truth Tables**: Systematic ways to represent logical relationships
- **Logic Gates**: Physical implementations of Boolean operations
- **Boolean Laws**: Mathematical properties that govern logical operations

## Boolean Algebra Subchapters

### 1. [Basics of Boolean Algebra](basics.md)

Learn the fundamental concepts of Boolean algebra, including binary variables, logical operations (AND, OR, NOT), and the basic laws that govern Boolean expressions.

### 2. [Truth Tables](truth-tables.md)

Master the systematic representation of logical relationships using truth tables. Learn how to construct, read, and use truth tables to analyze Boolean expressions and verify logical equivalences.

### 3. [Logic Gates](logic-gates.md)

Understand how Boolean operations are implemented in digital circuits through logic gates. Learn about the basic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and their symbols, truth tables, and practical applications.
